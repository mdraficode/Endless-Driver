# Session Handoff — Endless Driver

**Updated:** 2026-10-14  
**Current stage:** Phase 2 implemented and verified (Rapier vehicle physics, keyboard smoothing, dynamic chase camera)  
**Authorized development phase:** Phases 1–2 only  
**Next development instruction:** Wait for the user to explicitly authorize Phase 3

## 1. User instructions so far

| Instruction                                                                                         | State                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan the whole project in structured Markdown                                                       | Done — `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`                                         |
| Create the initial project structure and keep progress in the dedicated GitHub repository           | Done — public [`mdraficode/Endless-Driver`](https://github.com/mdraficode/Endless-Driver) |
| Implement Phase 1 (core engine setup and scene foundation) using Vite, TypeScript, and **Three.js** | Done — pushed, verified                                                                   |
| Implement Phase 2 (vehicle physics, keyboard smoothing, dynamic chase camera)                       | Done — see sections 3–5                                                                   |
| Do **not** start Phase 3 without explicit instruction                                               | Honored — no terrain, roads, streaming, or weather code exists                            |

Phase 2 was authorized with these constraints, all honored: Rapier **or** Cannon-es allowed (Rapier
chosen — sole physics authority, never two solvers); the slip-friction/drift behaviour is an explicit
requirement, not polish; keyboard only for now (touch stays in Phase 5); a placeholder/low-poly car
mesh is acceptable; wheels must visibly steer and roll from physics state.

## 2. Canonical repository and verified persistence

- **Repository:** [`mdraficode/Endless-Driver`](https://github.com/mdraficode/Endless-Driver) — **public**, default branch `main`.
- **Clone:** `https://github.com/mdraficode/Endless-Driver.git`
- Every session's checkpoint is pushed to `main` and its SHA verified against the GitHub API; CI
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm ci` + `npm run check` on Node 22.
- Obtain the current checkpoint from the repository (`git log -1 --oneline`) rather than trusting a
  hash written here.
- **Verified checkpoint (2026-10-14):** the Phase 2 feature commit `b85c8ba` (42 files) was pushed to
  `main`; `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` returned the same SHA, and the `Validate project`
  GitHub Actions run for that commit (`npm ci` + `npm run check` on Node 22) completed successfully.
- Authentication for pushing uses the owner's official GitHub CLI device flow. Device codes expire
  after ~15 minutes, so a fresh code must be issued and approved promptly in the same session.

## 4. Verification evidence

**Local gate:** `npm run check` passes — Prettier, ESLint, both TypeScript configs, **129 tests in 14
files**, and the Vite production build (`index` 600.23 kB, `rapier` 4 335.10 kB — see limitations).
Node 20.20.2 / npm 10.8.2 in this session; CI uses Node 22.

**Explicit performance caveat:** the browser runs used a **CPU software rasterizer** at ~15 FPS
(800×450), so the simulation advances at ~0.82× wall time there. These runs prove correctness and the
step-budget contract; they are **not** a hardware 60 FPS measurement and must not be quoted as one. A
real 60 FPS claim needs a named device, resolution, preset, and warm-up.

### Bugs found by verification and fixed

1. **Mid-arena obstacle in the spawn lane.** A 4×5×3 m block at (2, 2.5, −20) sat ~17 m ahead of the
   spawn heading and stopped straight-line runs. Moved to (14, 2.5, −24); `WORLD_CONFIG`'s header
   comment now records that obstacles stay clear of the spawn lane, and a physics test asserts the
   car can cover 45 m of clear road.
2. **Steering sign.** Positive steering initially yawed the car the wrong way; fixed with a single
   sign flip at the point where the action becomes a tire steer angle.
3. **Tire curve too flat to drift.** The initial lateral curvature put peak grip past 50° of slip, so
   the car could not break traction. Re-shaped to peak at ≈10.3° (see section 5).
4. **Input ramp stalling the response curve.** Applying the response exponent inside the ramp meant
   full throttle only reached ~0.095 of the target; the ramp is linear now and shaping happens on
   read, covered by a unit test.
5. **Camera roll corrupting `camera.up`.** Roll is applied inside the camera quaternion instead, so
   the horizon tilts without breaking the up vector.
6. **Obstacle collision test required an approach lane.** The Phase 2 collision test now approaches a
   known block from a clear lane, so it tests collision response rather than spawn-lane clearance.

| Braking                            | 3 400 N front / 2 200 N rear, handbrake 2 600 N on the rear axle                                       |

These numbers are recorded for reference, not asserted in CI, so retuning the car cannot silently
break the build. The tuning knobs live in `src/config/vehicle.ts` and `src/config/input.ts`.

## 6. Deliberate deviations and limitations

- **Custom wheel-force layer instead of Rapier's `DynamicRayCastVehicleController`** — the phase
  requires slip-dependent lateral grip and a handbrake that scales rear traction only; both are
  project code so they are tunable and testable. Rapier still integrates the chassis and resolves
  collisions; the two force paths are never combined. Recorded in ADR 0003.
- **Module naming:** the phase text named `src/core/Input.ts` and `src/core/Camera.ts`; they are
  implemented as `src/input/InputManager.ts` and `src/cameras/ChaseCamera.ts` to keep the planned
  module boundaries. No duplicate implementations exist.
- **Steering rate limiting lives in the input layer**, not in `Car` — `steering.maxRate`,
  `steering.smoothingSeconds`, and `brakes.responseSeconds` were removed from the vehicle config.
- **Placeholder car art.** `CarVisual` is box geometry, not a GLTF model; the plan allows a
  placeholder in this phase, and the asset inventory in `public/assets` is still empty.
- **Temporary arena.** Ground and obstacle geometry come from `WORLD_CONFIG`; the Phase 1 reference
  grid is retained purely as a motion cue for driving, not as a designed environment.
- **No touch controls yet** — mandatory multi-touch is Phase 5 scope, and no touch code exists.
- **Bundle size:** the Rapier chunk is ~4.3 MB (1.67 MB gzip); code splitting, load-time work, and
  quality selection remain Phase 6 concerns.
- **No gameplay HUD** beyond diagnostics: speed, gear, and RPM are shown for verification, not as a
  designed dashboard.

## 7. Next authorized step

Phase 3 (procedural terrain, road networks, chunk streaming, float-origin handling) is **not**
authorized. When it is:

1. Read this handoff, `AGENTS.md`, the plan's Phase 3 section, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Record the authorization in `AGENTS.md` and this file.
3. Keep Rapier as the sole physics authority; terrain colliders must come from the same generator as
   the visual mesh, and streaming must not allocate without bounds.
4. Add deterministic tests, run `npm run check`, perform browser verification, and record real
   evidence (no unverified performance claims).
5. Commit, push to `main`, verify the remote SHA and CI result, and stop before Phase 4.

## 8. Session continuity reminders

- Install with `npm ci`; the lockfile is committed and direct versions are pinned (TypeScript 5.9.3,
  Vitest 4.1.11 — do not bump casually).
- `npm run check` is the required gate before every commit; it includes formatting and lint, so run
  `npx prettier --write .` after editing files by hand.
- Do not commit `node_modules`, `dist`, credentials, or unlicensed assets.
- Authentication may need renewing in a fresh session; never request a token in chat and never commit
  credential material.
- If a push is blocked, record it plainly and export a bundle instead of claiming remote success.
